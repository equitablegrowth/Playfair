<h2>playfair</h2>
<h1>v2.4</h1>
<ul>
<li>You can make maps! US Counties and US states are included by default but you can do anything by dropping an SVG of it into the maps folder. The geographic units should be paths and they need to have a class name or id name that can be matched to the key you want to use for geographies. So if you want to use state abbreviations ("AL", "AK", etc.) then the path for alabama needs to have .AL or #AL (case insensitive). The state and county map I have included are pretty flexible by default.</li>
<li>Removed some of the graph parameters that are hard-coded and not available as settings. Added more settings.</li>
</ul>

<h1>v2.3</h1>
<ul>
<li>New version of savesvgaspng inlines fonts! Very cool, should make Playfair faster and save files much smaller.</li>
<li>Upgraded from v0.41 of Snap SVG to 0.51.</li>
<li>Fixed axes' range sometime being calculated incorrectly when values were missing.</li>
<li>Visual improvements for legends.</li>
<li>Fixed a recently introduced step-chart bug.</li>
<li>Floating legend locations now persist across redraws.</li>
<li>You can now reset legends if you accidentally deleted something you didn't mean to. Just hit the 'reset' button in the legends tab.</li>
<li>Fixed a small bug with missing data in line and step geoms.</li>
<li>Playfair will prevent you from using '>' and '<' in variable values as these make it impossible to save the graphic as a PNG.</li>
<li>All font face selectors in settings now allow you to select a font instead of having to type one in.</li>
<li>The load dialog now features a search box to help you find previously saved graphs.</li>
<li>You can now have log axes - find them in the design > axes tab. Playfair doesn't attempt to pick axes that look nice for logs so you may want to use a custom axis. Also recall that you can't log an axis that has negative values. Right now Playfair will just barf if you try.</li>
<li>Slight change to overall look and feel that I think is attractive.</li>
</ul>

<h1>v2.2</h1>
<ul>
<li>You can now save custom settings out as a theme to be used again.</li>
<li>Klugey CSS fix for some kind of styling change Chrome made in new version?</li>
<li>Source/note should now be vertically centered when there is a tall logo</li>
<li>Fixed graphical glitch where shading bars were drawn over grid instead of under</li>
<li>Fixed bug that made it impossible to change the color of selected text</li>
<li>Fixed issues with the positioning of legend titles</li>
<li>You can now smooth your line charts. Check the 'smooth lines' box in the lines element tab (or just change line_smoothing to 1 in settings or your theme). Thanks to Douglas Schepers for doing all the math so I don't have to (http://schepers.cc/getting-to-the-point).</li>
<li>Fixed some esoteric text bugs</li>
<li>Fixed issue where multiple line breaks in a block of text were ignored</li>
</ul>

<h1>v2.1</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fixed lots of bugs related to horizontal bar charts and also bar charts being used in combination with dates. Also applies to stacked bars.</li>
<li>Opacity settings for geom elements</li>
<li>Bounded area geom (in the area tab) and rectangle geom</li>
<li>Improvements to contextual menus and more options for editing on graph</li>
<li>Firefox basically works now. The GUI elements look bad and I don't want to invest time in CSS, but I believe Firefox is otherwise compatible. I am keenly interested in bug reports for Firefox.</li>
<li>Fixes that should result in a more asesthetically pleasing placement of the note and source</li>
<li>Fixes an issue loading graphs with variables that have spaces in their names</li>
</ul>

<h1>v2.0</h1>
<ul>
<li> So much stuff</li>
<li> The UI has been redesigned and a lot of stuff has been moved around</li>
<li> There are 2 redraw buttons now. The 2nd one redraws but keeps any custom annotations you have on the chart</li>
<li> You can now click the 'reset all fields' button to return the gui to its original state (kinda like refreshing the page)</li>
<li> Changelog looks less crappy</li>
<li> Charts now loosely modeled on the grammar of graphics as implemented in ggplot2. This allows you to implement any 'geom' (points, lines, bars, etc.) on to any chart in any combination. This vastly increases the types of charts you can create.</li>
<li> The following geoms are currently implemented:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>points</li>
        <li>bars</li>
        <li>lines</li>
        <li>shading</li>
        <li>segments</li>
        <li>stacked bars</li>
        <li>area</li>
        <li>text</li>
        <li>steps</li>
    </ul>
<li> Some geoms are more fleshed out than others. Stacked bars may be balky if you try to add other geoms to them, area charts can only be vertical, and there are some bugs associated with the line type option (although I think this is confined to keys).</li>
<li> The new trendline geom will allow you to specify trendlines for date data yay. You now have to give it a start and end point instead of a slope and intercept.</li>
<li> Existing geoms have gained some new options - you can now size lines according to a variable for example, if you want to create a slopegraph with a third dimensions.</li>
<li> Changes to data storage and refactoring of code to make adding geoms easier in the future</li>
<li> All geoms/chart types are now agnostic as to the type of axis. So you can make bar charts with a date axis or a numerical axis, line charts with a categorical axis and etc.</li>
<li> Saving has changed a fair bit and the geom structure is incompatible with the way Playfair used to handle charts, so pre 2.0 saves are incompatible with 2.0</li>
<li> In addition to creating custom axes, you can now specify limits for you graph. For example, if you specify an axis of 1,1.5,2,2.5 and limits of .5,3, there will be ticks at the axis numbers, but the graph will will start and end at .5 and 3. It doesn't seem to work properly with the bar geom right now however.</li>
<li> Missing data is handled much differently now. If your dataset has missing data, the row will not be subject to listwise deletion. Instead the row will be kept and, when possible, used for graphing. Moreover, if you are creating a line graph, missing data will be interpreted as interruptions in the line. If you don't want gaps in your line, remove missing data first. Missing data should be exactly that - missing. If comma delimited - ',,' etc. A dot from Stata or similar will work in some instances but not others.</li>
<li> Please use custom axes and limits for dates cautiously right now and report any problems to me - in certain circumstances they may lead to incorrectly positioned data.</li>
<li> You now have more flexibility when creating keys. The legend tab will show you a rough preview of what your key will look like. you can delete rows in the key by x'ing them out. You can also add a title to the key and you can restrict the width of the key, which may be useful if you have very long group names. Keep in mind that you can still change graph element attributes after the fact ie by right-clicking a line to make it dotted or etc, so not everything needs to be captured in your key, or in your graph setup, before graphing.</li>
<li> Removed references to offsetLeft and offsetTop. Chrome has moved to using getBoundingClientRect and Firefox already was, so this improves compatibility for adding notations to the graph.</li>
<li> Fixed some bugs that prevented SVG or PNG saving.</li>
<li> Playfair should pick much better axes for date-based axes now. It will also now be a little more willing to accept more tick marks if it means having less wasted space.</li>
</ul>

<h1>v1.7</h1>
<ul>
<li> Finally fixed that bug that resulted in vertically and horizontally mis-aligned y-axis labels</li>
<li> Possible to have x and yaxis labels that stretch over two lines now (but no more, and there is now a max length restriction).</li>
<li> There are now more restrictions for the lengths of heads and subheads. Write shorter heads/subheads!</li>
<li> You can now load themes into playfair. This is in the design/style tab but don&#39;t actually use it yet. We may eventually have a second graph style but for now we are still just using the official one.</li>
<li> You can now coerce playfair to parse a variable as text, numeric, or date. Use this when for example you have year data like 1989, 1990, etc. that Playfair would not normally parse as a date. At the moment, if you change your data, it will cause Playfair to reevaluate the data and reset your variable selections.</li>
<li> I think I&#39;ve solved all the problems with missing data but I can&#39;t swear to it. Please let me know.</li>
<li> Custom axes for dates are now possible.</li>
</ul>

<h1>v1.6</h1>
<ul>
<li> Playfair has moved servers and is no longer anti-union or anti-anything. All saves should work.</li>
<li> Recoloring an arrow works now</li>
</ul>

<h1>v1.5</h1>
<ul>
<li> Grouped barcharts with negative values now work. This is all kinda hanging together with gum and paper clips until I rewrite all the bar chart stuff. Please make sure your values are correct and etc.</li>
<li> Fixed a bug where certain datasets had problems with axes being drawn correctly. Thanks Nick!</li>
</ul>

<h1>v1.4</h1>
<ul>
<li> THIS UPGRADE BREAKS A BUNCH OF STUFF ON OLD GRAPHS. You will have to redraw old graphs to get contextual menus and color changing to work. Big changes to how things work under the hood that don&#39;t really matter to users but let me know if changing colors or contextual menus are acting strangely.</li>
</ul>

<h1>v1.3</h1>
<ul>
<li> Stacked barcharts with negative values now work</li>
<li> Minor layout changes</li>
</ul>

<h1>v1.25</h1>
<ul>
<li> You can now add horizontal lines to charts with date data on the xaxis. Trend lines with slopes and vertical lines are still quite broken. This is a tricky problem.</li>
<li> fixed a bug where sometimes footers had transparent strips in them</li>
<li> Fixed the bug where hovering/unhovering sometimes shrunk text. Now text just gets a shadow on rollover.</li>
<li> Multiline text flow for hed/dek/source/note should be waaaaay better now. This does slow down redraw a bit.</li>
</ul>

<h1>v1.2</h1>
<ul>
<li> Fixed some of the bugs that caused trend lines to multiply when saving/loading graphs</li>
<li> added settings options for text colors</li>
<li> I think I fixed that bug where sometimes hovering/unhovering causes elements/text to shrink</li>
<li> Fixed a bug where callouts did not drag the circle with them after being loaded and dragged</li>
</ul>

<h1>v1.15</h1>
<ul>
<li> Changed the third point option to something that should look better for large numbers of overlapping points, like in Nick&#39;s wage to inflation passthrough graph.</li>
<li> When playfair fails to save or fails to render a graph, it will now alert you, with an error message that may or may  not be helpful</li>
<li> Fixed a bug with loading a graph and rotated text</li>
<li> Slightly changed the default leftmargin variable</li>
<li> Data parser now ignores trailing carriage returns. Should make it a little more robust to human error when pasting in from excel.</li>
<li> Disabled nologo graphs. Use a logo, or else!</li>
<li> Contextual menus will now appear higher on the screen if they would be truncated by the bottom of your browser window</li>
<li> You can now choose &#39;move to front&#39; in contextual menus to move a data element or path in front of other elements</li>
<li> Fixed a bug where loading a graph with multiple trendlines would not load those trendlines into the frontend interface</li>
</ul>

<h1>v1.1</h1>
<ul>
<li> Really esoteric text bug that was putting spaces after things where it shouldn&#39;t have.</li>
<li> When you save, selected text will be unselected, which should prevent situations where you can&#39;t unselect text after loading a graph.</li>
<li> You can now make small changes to your data without resetting all the variable menus</li>
<li> Fix to opacity on selected text</li>
<li> There is now a text cursor that you can move back and forth with the arrow keys. Everything seems to be working pretty well with it but there are probably bugs, please let me know.</li>
<li> Slight change to vertical tab style</li>
<li> Fixed an issue with text nudging on certain text elements</li>
<li> Added some text boxes that tell you what all you can do on the graphing canvas</li>
</ul>


<h1>v1.05</h1>
<ul>
<li> Various multiline text fixes</li>
<li> You can now drag callout arrows/lines around the graph</li>
<li> Various callout fixes</li>
<li> Fix for floating keys being immobile after load</li>
</ul>

<h1>v1.0</h1>  
<ul>
<li> First Public Release</li>
<li> Serverside saving and loading!</li>
<li> Various fixes for multiline text</li>
<li> Bug fixes for notes, sources, and nologo layouts</li>
</ul>

<h1>v0.7</h1>
<ul>
<li> UI redesign makes the UI a bit less awful.</li>
<li> Resized logo</li>
<li> No logo layout enabled</li>
<li> Settings tab enabled. You can do all sorts of crazy things here if you want to be hardcore.</li>
<li> line charts with >8 groups will now connect properly</li>
<li> Top keys work again and are now positioned in a more aesthetically pleasing way</li>
<li> I <b>think</b> I finally fixed the last of the trendline bugs but please check your trendlines carefully to make sure they are what they&#39;re supposed to be.</li>
<li> You can now &#39;label data&#39; a path just like you can points and bars. The label is <b>always</b> the group the line belongs to (the label variable field is ignored) and it appears at the right endpoint of the line.</li>
<li> Using &#39;label data&#39; with horizontal bars now makes a lot more sense.</li>
<li> When you mouse over a data element now, that element&#39;s label will appear on screen while you hover the object  useful for finding a particular line or whatever that you want to apply a permanent label too.</li>
<li> When you are editing text you can now press return and get a carriage return. This is great for long annotations. I haven&#39;t done a ton of testing of this feature so I&#39;d be curious to know if it behaves strangely in certain situations.</li>
<li> Source/note fields will now expand the footer of the graph if the text overflows the height of the logo.</li>
<li> You can delete callouts and arrows now (no seriously this time you really can)</li>
<li> Now supports more of the date formats that I claimed it supported in the first place (thanks Ben)</li>
<li> Recession shading now supported in Firefox</li>
<li> Support for dates in the form &#39;1992q1&#39;</li>
</ul>

<h1>v0.6</h1>
<ul>
<li> Fixed a bug that made the logo appear blurry.</li>
<li> New tools splash screen</li>
</ul>

<h1>v0.5</h1>
<ul>
<li> Horizontal barcharts are now available.</li>
<li> Stacked barcharts are now available.</li>
<li> Fixed a bug that caused problems for axes with ranges </li>
</ul>

<h1>v0.4</h1>
<ul>
<li> US recession shading and arbitrary shading can be found in Line/Scatter > Line/Scatter style. I know, the UI looks terrible. You can only shade on the xaxis (is there a reason you&#39;d want to shade on the yaxis?) To use the default US recession shading, your xaxis <b>must</b> be a date data type. For arbitrary shading, you can either specify number intervals (ie [3,4]) or date intervals (ie [01/01/1997,05/01/1997]). It recognizes all the same date formats that the data parser does.</li>
</ul>

<h1>v0.3</h1>
<ul>
<li> You can now choose a custom height and width for you graph. You should generally stick to a width of 745 pixels as this is the width of columns on our website. Height can be anything though. Also of note  reducing the width won&#39;t do much for you. We currently lack the ability to flow text around an image, so you can&#39;t have a leftaligned graph with text around it. This feature is pretty experimental, see if you can break it maybe?</li>
<li> You can now have multiple trend lines on a graph  just press the &#39;+&#39; button to bring up another one. I know the interface is a bit of a mess right now  bear with me. By default they will all be labeled &#39;Trend Line&#39; but you can rightclick to delete these text elements. You can also now have vertical trendlines by entering &#39;&#39; as the slope and the desired xintercept as the intercept. As with other line elements, you can rightclick a trend line  to make it dashed, thicker or thinner, or change the color.</li>
<li> You can now delete callouts and arrows you have placed on the graph by rightclicking on them and picking &#39;delete&#39;.</li>
<li> You can now change the visual appearance of points in scatter/line plots. In particular you can now select a smaller, solid point that looks better in time series. You can select this in the line/scatter styles section or by rightclicking on a point and selecting the point style you want.</li>
<li> By rightclicking on a scatter point, you can choose to make the point bigger or smaller.</li>
<li> By rightclicking on a line in a line plot, you can make that line thicker/thinner.</li>
<li> More elements will now recognize when they are being hovered.</li>
<li> Fixed a bug where you couldn&#39;t eliminate the major ygrids.</li>
</ul>

<h1>v0.2</h1>
<ul>
<li> Date parsing: Playfair can now handle a date data type. The data alert box will inform you that your column has been parsed as a date. Check and make sure! All rows of the column must parse as a date  one missing observation will prevent proper parsing. Only certain formats are recognized as dates. Any of the following should work:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>1981-02-28 (FRED format)</li>
        <li>02-28-1981</li>
        <li>02/28/1981</li>
        <li>02-28-81</li>
        <li>02/28/81</li>
        <li>02/1981</li>
        <li>02-1981</li>
        <li>February 1981</li>
        <li>February 26 1981</li>
        <li>February 26, 1981</li>
    </ul>
<li> If there are other formats Playfair should recognize, please log these as bugs. It intentionally does not recognize sequences like 1996, 1997 as years  either edit out commas in these sequences manually, format them without commas, or format them in your data as 1/1/1996, 1/1/1997, etc.  It also doesn&#39;t really handle amounts of time that should be denominated in hours. So if you want to track a stock from 2PM to 2PM the next day, you will want to simply count out the hours (ie your data is 1,2,3,4,...) and then use a custom axis as appropriate. You cannot currently use custom axes with date data.</li>
<li> When you hover over a data element on a graph, it will now be highlighted, which should make it easier to rightclick on an element and alter its color or etc.</li>
<li> When you rightclick on a linechart line, you can now change that line to a dashed line using the contextual menu that appears (or a dashed line to a solid line).</li>
<li> Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
